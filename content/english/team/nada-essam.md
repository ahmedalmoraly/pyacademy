Hi, this is Nada :). I got my Master's degree in Computer Science from New Mexico State University in 2022. I have two years of experience as a backend developer, and I have worked as a Teaching Assistant in New Mexico State University. I am very passionate about teaching and transferring my experience in software development to our future developers.
