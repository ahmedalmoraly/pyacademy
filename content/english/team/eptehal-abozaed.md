Hi, my name is Eptehal!
I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Cairo University in Egypt. I have more than 10 years of experience in Quality Control and Software Development. In addition, I have been coaching First Lego League teams (FLL Challenge) during the last two years. I love teaching programming to kids and looking forward to helping the new generation to find their potential in the world of technology ;).
