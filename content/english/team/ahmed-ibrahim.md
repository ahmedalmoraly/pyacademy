Hiii, I’m Ahmed. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I have been self-studying programming for two years. I was the team lead for a robotics team that participated in the FIRST Technical Challenge (FTC) for two years and qualified for the NC State Championship twice. I have experience in both Python and block-based programming.
